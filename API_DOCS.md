# API Documentation

All protected endpoints require a JWT token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

This document lists the backend API endpoints available in the project and includes example requests and notes. Example values use neutral placeholders like `alice` and `alice@example.com`.

## Notes & Best Practices

- Rate limiting and other protections are enabled on sensitive endpoints (password reset, auth endpoints).
- Always include the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for protected endpoints.
- The AI endpoints return both raw `content` (which may contain Markdown) and a sanitized `html` field — prefer rendering Markdown client-side (e.g., `flutter_markdown`) or using the `html` fallback if the client cannot parse Markdown.
- Use realistic test accounts (e.g., `alice@example.com`) when trying the API; do not publish real user credentials.

If you want, I can also generate a Postman collection export from the repository's existing example collection (the project already contains Postman JSON under `POSTMAN/`).
